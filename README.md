# Job-Clustering-Based-on-Job-Description
Job Clustering Based on Job Description using NLTK


This Notebook shows how to cluster a set of documents using Python. My motivating example is to identify the latent structures within the JobDescription. 

This jupyter notebook covers:

### Tokenizing and stemming each synopsis
### Transforming the corpus into vector space using tf-idf
### Calculating cosine distance between each document as a measure of similarity
### Clustering the documents using the k-means algorithm
